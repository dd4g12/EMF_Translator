# EventB_Translator_Support
Adaptation of the EMF translator for Event-B and Rodin

Plug-in contains:-
1) an adapter that can be used (i.e. referenced in the extension declaration) by translators (based on ac.soton.emf.translator) that target the Event-B EMF meta-model.
2) a command handler that can be used (i.e. referenced in the extension declaration) by translators (based on ac.soton.emf.translator) that are invoked by selecting a Rodin element.
